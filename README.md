## BlackVault Database Managment System

### Description

This is my first post on PSC and it happens to be my biggest program ever attempted. It is not really clossed to finished but it proves that it can be done, it is a fully functional DBMS made in VB, this includes SQL queries, multiple tables, unlimited columns, validation rules, editing feild properties. This program is not yet in beta stage, with large amounts of work to be done.

I am posting this to get feedback from other people on things I could add to make the program much better or change to give it more functianality. All comments are welcome.

My main reason for posting this is that a few days ago the VB code of the day was a table so called DB creater, but could only take one table.

There is a lot of string manipulation in this with the DB save in a plain text file (yes I know that could become corupted easily, i am going to work on measures to prevent that and solve coruptions)

In certian sections the program is fairly well documented but in others not, thats something I need to do soon.

Well please give me any feedback or even test the system out, included in the ZIP is an example DB called Test.bvd

you can load this and mess around with it, delete records, do SQL queries, add records, export as XML and all, some of the functions in the menu do not exist but are there to remind me of what is to come :P

If you wish to vote for this do so, but as I said the program is not finished, it is more a proof of concept

to show others that it is plausible.

Its around 4K lines and will probably be 10K by the time it nears finish time.
