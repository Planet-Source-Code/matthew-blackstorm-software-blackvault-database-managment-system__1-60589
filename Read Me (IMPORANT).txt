If you wish to use this program or use large quantites of code for some reason please contact me,
This code is all of my own except the MD5 class, which still contains the authors original details
and his copyright information. 

This program is not even in beta stage and is a fair way off of it, but I'm posting to get some 
ideas or a little discussion with other programmers as to where I could speed it up or make things
better. This has been a pretty big project and have not had a great deal of time lately to continue
so not much progress has been made in the past 4 months, but come next break I will hope to do much
more on it.

So here is the run down of what can you do;
	- Make tables
		- Set column properties
		- Set some validation rules (these are not all working currently)
		- Set MD5 password feilds
		
	- View talbes
		- View properties of a table and total size and set ReadOnly on table

	- Export tables in XML format (hopefully soon will also have HTML function)

	- Run SQL queries on the tables 
		Usable syntax
		- SELECT, FROM, WHERE
		- Count(*), *
		
		SQL structure
		- all feilds in SELECT statment must have the table name with is ie [Phone Book]![Age]
		- Currently only one Table queries work so one table in the FROM statment only ie [Phone Book]
		- Currently there is not option for AND NOT OR in the where statment
	
	Example queries inlcude
	
	<SQL To select all feilds and records from the Phone Book Table>
		SELECT *
		FROM [Phone Book]
	</SQL>

	<SQL To select the age of a person whose name is "James">
		SELECT [Phone Book]![Age]
		FROM [Phone Book]
		WHERE [Phone Book]![Name]="James"
	</SQL>
	
	<SQL To count the total number of people in the Phone Book table>
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM [Phone Book]
	</SQL>

	<SQL To count the total number of people in the Phone Book table>
		SELECT *
		FROM [Phone Book]
		WHERE [Phone Book]![Age]=14
	</SQL>
	
	Well thats most of the stuff
